I'm Dr. Gylfin, an amateur developer.  I'm generally curious (in both senses of the word), and write here about my development projects and just general technology things that I find interesting.  I'm particularly interested in the ways technology affects our daily lives, and how we can defend ourselves from it.

While I'm hardly a luddite, I often see understanding technology through a defensive lens: we have to know how this stuff works, and in particular the dangers, to protect ourselves from the more predatory uses.  These can come in the more obvious forms like malware, but also in the ways those in power use it to try to influence us.  The fear has traditionally been from governments, and while not negligible, I think corporate powers (to the extent they're distinguishable) are the greater threat to our minds.

I don't want to be hyperbolic, but this is a real threat: all one has to do is look at the studies linking social media usage to depression.  To be clear, I don't see a grand conspiracy to enslave us; it's more the paper clip AI problem.  In other words, it's where we're dealing with powerful entities whose interests don't align with ours as individuals, but who simply *do not care*.

I also think technology has a way of eliding the human element.  People drawn to computers, or at least people who become "entrepeneurs" or whatever, tend to see people as one element to an equation, but people don't work that way.  But as Frank Herbert reminds us in *Dune*:

> Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.

As far as my own programming, I'm interested in writing things that help me (and hopefully others) in dealing with the more human aspects of ourselves.  For example, I've long been fascinated by the occult, even if I don't believe that magic(k) does what many seem to think it does.  I enjoy it from a storytelling perspective, and I think it's useful to remind ourselves that not everything *should* be explained scientifically, regardless of whether it can, which is itself less frequent than we imagine.  My ideal world is one where the spiritual and the technological/scientific aren't seen as opposites.

My name comes from the Welsh word for "beak," and is a reference to one of the euphamisms for plague doctors.  There's a famous 18th-century woodcut of one titled "Dr. Beak," hence the name.  I love the plague doctor look in general, but also enjoy what they symbolize to me as a microcosm of human nature.  Some of these people were frauds, some genuinely believed they could help (and sometimes did).  The latter displayed immense courage.  Yet they had imperfect knowledge of what they faced, something that resonates with me a great deal.  But they also serve as a reminder not to let this lack of knowledge paralyze us.  Sometimes we just have to do our best with what we have.
